# GoAggregateRSS

I love Golang

I am learning Golang for a software development internship and this is my first decent project I am building for practice.

It currently aggregates multiple RSS feeds into an SQL database.

Soon I will implement a API endpoint where a client can consume these items, I am also considering pre sorting them by most recent so the consumer can just iterate through a list when trying to display the objects on front end.

## Libraries

I am currently utilizing:

go-sqlite3
gofeed
